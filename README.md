This simulator is built based on explanations in *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach* textbook by Abou-Kassem et al (2006). This simulator is built using Python language. The goal of this simulator is that we understand how a reservoir simulator works. So, we will build from scratch, from a very simple reservoir model to more advanced.
