This simulator is built based on explanations in *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach* textbook by Abou-Kassem et al (2006), built using Python language. The goal of this simulator is that we understand how a reservoir simulator works. So, we will build from scratch, from a very simple reservoir model to more advanced.

### Case 1. 1D rectangular reservoir, homogeneous, single-phase

<div>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51282928/88264056-526ab480-ccf5-11ea-9cd0-622b6a57af6b.png" width="500"/>

> A 5000 ft x 1200 ft x 75 ft horizontal reservoir contains oil that flows
along its length. The reservoir rock porosity and permeability are 0.18 and 15 md,
respectively. The oil FVF and viscosity are 1 RB/STB and 10 cp, respectively. The
reservoir has a well located at 3500 ft from the reservoir left boundary and
produces oil at a rate of 150 STB/D. 

#### Using [`floweq_1d`](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/pyresim/blob/master/simulators/floweq_1d.py) to produce the flow equations in each of the grid blocks

### Case 2. 2D rectangular reservoir, homogeneous, single-phase

</div>

> 4x3 reservoir. A well located in grid block 7 produces at a rate of 4000
STB/D. AIIgridblocks have Î”x = 250 ft, Î”y = 300 ft, h = 100 ft, kx = 270 md,
and ky = 220 md. The FVF and viscosity of the flowing fluid are 1.0 RB/STB and 2
cp, respectively. The reservoir south boundary is maintained at 3000 psia, the
reservoir west boundary is sealed off to flow, the reservoir east boundary is kept
at a constant pressure gradient of O. 1 psi/ft, and the reservoir loses fluid across its
north boundary at a rate of 500 STB/D.

#### Using [`floweq_2d`](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/pyresim/blob/master/simulators/floweq_2d.py) to produce the flow equations in each of the grid blocks

### Case 3. 3D rectangular reservoir, homogeneous, single-phase

</div>

> 4x3x3 reservoir. All grid blocks have
Î”x = 250 ft, Î”y = 30Oft, Î”z = 33.333 ft, kx = 270 md, ky = 220 md, and kz = 50 md.
The FVF, density, and viscosity of the flowing fluid are 1.0 RB/STB, 55 Ibm/ft3,
and 2 cp, respectively.

#### Using [`floweq_3d`](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/pyresim/blob/master/simulators/floweq_3d.py) to produce the flow equations in each of the grid blocks

### Case 4. 2D cylindrical reservoir (well in the middle), homogeneous, varying size in radial direction

</div>

> A 0.5-ft diameter water well is located in 20-acre spacing. The
reservoir thickness, horizontal permeability, and porosity are 30 ft, 150 md, and
0.23, respectively. The (kv/kh) for this reservoir is estimated from core data as
0.30. The flowing fluid has a density, FVF, and viscosity of 62.4 lbm/ft3, 1 RB/B, and
0.5 cp, respectively. The reservoir external boundary in the radial direction is a no flow
boundary, and the well is completed in the top 20 ft only and produces at a rate
of 2000 B/D. The reservoir bottom boundary is subject to influx such that the
boundary is kept at 4000 psia. The reservoir top boundary is sealed to flow.
Assuming the reservoir can be simulated using 3 equal gridblocks in the vertical
direction and 4 gridblocks in the radial direction.

## Using PyReSim for Academic Use or Industry

For any specific need that is unique to your case, and want to use PyReSim for your specific need, you are encouraged to discuss with me. I could provide a tutorial for your need. Presented here are the simulator codes applied to the cases presented above. I hope PyReSim can help to simulate most of your needs.
