### Simulation Cases 

* 1D one-dimensional
* 2D two-dimensional (regular reservoir geometry)
* 2D two-dimensional (irregular reservoir geometry)
* Cylindrical

For 2D reservoirs, there are two kinds: non-elevated and elevated

Each of these is simulated in five ways: 

* Incompressible (single-phase water or gas-free oil)
* Slightly compressible (single-phase live or volatile oil)
* Compressible (single-phase gas)
* Two-phase oil-water
* Two-phase oil-gas
* Two-phase water-gas
* Three-phase water-oil-gas
