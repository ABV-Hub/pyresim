17/08/2020
* modify `lhs_coeffs1d_welltype` and `rhs_constant1d_welltype` to include `slicomp` (slightly compressible solver) for 1D reservoir
* modify `read_input` to include reading `CFLUID` variable from input .TXT data
* upload 2 benchmark 1D data: `benchmark1d_incomp` and `benchmark1d_slicomp`
* 1D incompressible, 1D slightly compressible, 2D incompressible PASS the benchmark test
